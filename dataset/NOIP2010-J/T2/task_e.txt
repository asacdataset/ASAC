Receiving Water

Problem Description
There is a water room in the school. There are a total of m faucets in the water room for students to open to get water. Each faucet has the same amount of water per second, which is 1.

Now there are n students ready to get water, and their initial order of receiving water has been determined. Number these students in the order of receiving water from 1 to n, and the amount of water that student i gets is wi. At the beginning of receiving water, students from 1 to m each occupy a faucet and turn on the faucet to receive water at the same time. When one of the students j has completed the water receiving requirement wj, the next student k waiting in line to receive water immediately takes over from the place of student j and starts to receive water. This substitution process is completed instantly, and there is no waste of water. That is, when student j finishes receiving water at the end of the x second, then student k starts receiving water immediately at the x+1 second. If the current number of people receiving water n is less than m, only n faucets will supply water, and the other m-n faucets will be closed. 
Now give the amount of water received by n students, and ask how many seconds it takes for all the students to receive the water according to the above rules.

Input
In the first line, there are two integers n and m, separated by a space, respectively indicating the number of people receiving water and the number of faucets.
In the second line, there are n integers w1, w2, ..., wn, separated by a space between every two integers, wi represents the amount of water received by student i.

[Constraints]
1 ≤ n ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, and m≤ n;
1 ≤ wi ≤ 100.

Output
The output is only one line, with 1 integer, which represents the total time required for receiving water.
