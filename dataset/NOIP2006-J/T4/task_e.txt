Sequence

Problem description
Given a positive integer k (3 ≤ k ≤ 15), form an increasing sequence of all powers of k and the sum of all finite powers of k that are not equal to each other. For example, when k = 3, the sequence is:

1,3,4,9,10,12,13...

(the sequence is actually: 30, 31, 30 +31, 32, 30+32, 31+32, 30+31+32, ...)

Please find the value of the Nth term in this sequence (expressed in decimal numbers).

For example, for k = 3 and N = 100, the correct answer would be 981.

Input
The input file contains two positive integers, separated by a space:
k N (the meanings of k and N are the same as the above problem description, and 3 ≤ k ≤ 15,10 ≤ N ≤ 1000).

Output
The output file is a positive integer (No spaces or other symbols before integers).
