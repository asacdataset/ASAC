Calculate the coefficients

Problem Description
Given a polynomial (by+ax)k, please calculate the coefficients of the xn√ó ym term when the polynomial is expanded.

Input
The input is only one line and contains 5 integers called a,b,k,n,m, separated by spaces.

Output
The output is only one line and contains an integer representing the desired coefficient.
This coefficient can be very large, so output the result modulo 10007.
