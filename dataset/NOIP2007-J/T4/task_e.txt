These disks are now to be moved to the pillar C, which can be temporarily stored on the pillar B during the movement. Requirements :

(1) Only allowed to move one disk at a time;

(2) The disks on A, B, C three pillars must maintain the order of small to large; 

Task: let An be the minimum number of moves required by moving 2n disks to complete the above task, for the input n, output An.

Input
The input file contains a positive integer n, indicating that 2n disks are placed on pillar A.

Output
The output file contains a positive integer as the minimum number of moves An required to complete the above task.
