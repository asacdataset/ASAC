 Solve the Equation

Problem Description
Given the polynomial equation:

a0 + a1x + a2x2 + ... + anxn = 0

Find an integer solution to this equation in [1,m] (n and m are both positive integers).

Input
Enter a total of N + 2 lines.

The first line contains 2 integers, n and m, separated by a space.

The next n+1 lines contain one integer each. The integers are a0, a1, a2 ... an, respectively.

Output
The first line outputs the number of integer solutions to the equation within [1, m].

Next, there is one integer per line, each representing one integer solution of the equation within [1, m] in ascending order.
