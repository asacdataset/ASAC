Magic Square

Problem Description
A magic square is an amazing N*N matrix: it consists of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., N × N, and the sum of the numbers in each row, column and two diagonals is the same.

When N is odd, we can construct a magic square by:

First write the number 1 in the middle of the first row.

After that, fill in each number K in ascending order as follows (K=2, 3, ..., N * N) :

1. If (K-1) is in the first row but not in the last column, then put K in the last row, one column to the right of (K-1);
2. If (K-1) is in the last column but not in the first row, put K in the first column, one row above the row of (K-1);
3. If (K-1) is in the last column of the first row, put K right below (K-1);
4. If (K-1) is neither in the first row nor in the last column, put K in the top right of (K-1) if there is no number in the top right of (K-1), otherwise put K right below (K-1).

Now given N, construct an N × N magic square as described above.

Input
A positive integer N, which is the size of the magic square.

Output
N lines of N integers per line, that is, an N × N magic square constructed as described above, separated by a single space between every two adjacent integers.
